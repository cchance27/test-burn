# 5.1 Quick Wins — Detailed Implementation Plan

Scope: Implement the items in 5.1 of GGML-METALLIC.md with a robust, idiomatic Rust design that enables zero-copy tensor use, strongly-typed dispatch, A/B testing, and clean developer experience for adding new kernels.

Primary goals
- Shape-aware matmul dispatcher with strongly-typed kernel variants and zero-copy handoffs.
- Consistent fused alpha/beta usage across matmul call sites.
- Prefer logical transpose for K in SDPA; avoid permutes.
- Parameterize softmax threadgroup sizing and introduce simdgroup reductions (when available).
- Extend pipeline cache keys to reflect specialization factors.
- Provide feature flags and test-only kernel registration for A/B experiments.
- Integrate instrumentation (with_gpu_scope) and memory/latency tracking.

Progress checklist (updated)

  - Updated `README.md` with comprehensive environment variable documentation
  - Created `docs/DISPATCHER.md` with detailed dispatcher documentation

High-level design
- Strong types and enums for dispatch
  - Define `MatmulBackend` (MLX, MPS, Custom) and `MatmulVariant` (SmallN{n_bucket}, GemmSimdgroup{tile}, GemmGeneric).
  - Define `SoftmaxVariant` (Vec, Block) with policy traits to encapsulate TG sizing and reduction strategy.
  - Use exhaustive `match` for selection to avoid footguns; unit-test the selector.
- Zero-copy routing
  - All tensor views carry shape and stride metadata. Dispatch must honor non-compact strides and logical transposes.
  - Backends must accept strideful views or provide a contiguous fast-path if already contiguous. Avoid permutes/copies.
- Registry-based kernel manager (per docs/KERNELS.md)
  - Ensure `KernelManager` registers `matmul_dispatch` entry; dispatcher does not itself implement math, only selection and handoff to `matmul_*` kernels.
  - Implemented `MatmulDispatchOp` (invocable) in `matmul_dispatcher/dispatch_op.rs`; exported in `kernels/mod.rs` for use with `Context::call`.
  - A `KernelRegistry` mapping `(DType, VariantKey)` -> `KernelHandle` loaded via `KernelManager`.
  - Test-only kernels may be registered behind a `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "exp_kernels"))]` gate.
- Feature flags / Env vars
  - `METALLIC_MATMUL_BACKEND={mlx|mps|custom|auto}`
  - `METALLIC_MATMUL_VARIANT_FORCE={smalln|gemm|auto}` and `METALLIC_SMALLN_MAX_N=8` (tune via benches)
  - `METALLIC_SOFTMAX_VARIANT={vec|block|auto}`
  - These allow A/B testing and quick rollback.

Public API surfaces (unchanged semantics)
- Keep existing `matmul_alpha_beta(...)` signature and SDPA APIs stable.
- Introduce a kernel entrypoint `matmul_dispatch` so callers can `ctx.call<matmul_dispatch>(...)` (per docs/KERNELS.md pattern). Internally it selects and invokes one of `matmul_mlx`, `matmul_mps`, or `matmul_gemv`.
- Allow callers to pass transpose flags; prefer logical transpose handling.

Detailed steps

1) Types and enums
- Add in `crates/metallic/src/kernels/matmul_dispatcher/`: 
  - `pub enum MatmulBackend { Auto, MLX, MPS, Custom }`
  - `pub enum SmallNBucket { N1, N2, N4, N8, N16, Other }`
  - `pub enum GemmTile { T64x32xK, T64x64xK, Generic }`
  - `pub enum MatmulVariant { SmallN(SmallNBucket), GemmSimd(GemmTile), GemmGeneric }`
  - `pub struct MatmulCaps { has_simdgroup_mm: bool, device_family: DeviceFamily }`
  - `pub struct MatShape { m: usize, k: usize, n: usize }`
  - `pub struct MatmulPolicy { backend: MatmulBackend, variant: MatmulVariant }`
- Implement `From<usize> for SmallNBucket` to bucketize N.
- Implement `Display` / `Debug` where helpful.

2) Dispatcher
- New module: `matmul_dispatcher/dispatcher.rs` with:
  - `pub fn select_policy(shape: MatShape, dtype: DType, caps: &MatmulCaps, prefs: &Prefs) -> MatmulPolicy`
  - Selection order:
    - If prefs.force_backend != Auto -> backend = forced
    - If prefs.force_variant == SmallN and N<=16 -> SmallN bucket
    - Else if N<=8 -> SmallN bucket
    - Else if caps.has_simdgroup_mm && shape.m >= 64 && shape.n >= 16 -> GemmSimd(default tile)
    - Else -> GemmGeneric
  - Resolve backend:
    - Prefer MLX for GemmGeneric if available; else MPS; allow Custom when variant requires it.
  - Use exhaustive match to construct a `DispatchPlan`:
    - `enum DispatchPlan { UseMLX(MatmulVariant), UseMPS(MatmulVariant), UseCustom(MatmulVariant) }`
- Add unit tests for key shapes and env-forced cases.

3) Handoff layer
- Implement `execute_matmul(plan: DispatchPlan, args: MatmulArgs) -> Result<()>` in `matmul_dispatcher/execute.rs` and route to `matmul_mlx`, `matmul_mps`, or `matmul_gemv` accordingly that:
  - Preserves strides and transpose flags, preferring logical transpose.
  - Calls MLX/MPS/Custom entry points.
  - Ensures fused alpha/beta is honored.
  - Uses `with_gpu_scope!("matmul", labels... )` to label variant and shape.
- Validate zero-copy by asserting no intermediate allocations unless strictly needed.

4) MLX/MPS path audit for alpha/beta fusion
- Review callers of `matmul_alpha_beta` and ensure the fused path is used across call sites (QK, AV, feed-forward).
- Add tests that compare result of fused call vs unfused composition for numerical parity.

5) Custom Small-N kernel stub integration
- Define trait:
  - `pub trait CustomMatmulKernel { fn launch(&self, args: &MatmulArgs) -> Result<()>; fn key(&self) -> VariantKey; }`
- Provide placeholder registration (no-op kernel that calls MLX temporarily) under `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "exp_kernels"))]`:
  - This enables wiring of selection and benchmarking before real kernel exists.
- Bench-only kernels can be registered via a registry macro in tests.

6) Cache key extensions
- Extend `ResourceCache`/`KernelManager` keys to include:
  - Transpose flags for A/B, β!=0 marker, SmallN bucket, Gemm tile, dtype.
  - For SDPA softmax: seq_k bucket, causal flag, reduction impl (simdgroup/shared).
- Add tests to ensure different keys don't collide.

7) Softmax parameterization (foundation only in 5.1)
- Introduce `SoftmaxVariant` enum { Vec, Block, Auto } and `SoftmaxPrefs` from env.
- Parameterize threadgroup size by nearest pow2 <= seq_k, min(device_limit).
- Optional simdgroup reduction path behind capability flag (implementation can land in 5.2; 5.1 wires selection and params).
- Ensure `with_gpu_scope!("softmax", ...)` records variant and tg size.

8) SDPA logical transpose preference
- Modify SDPA path to prefer transpose_k=true and pass K with transposed strides when backend supports it (MLX path).
- Add guard to avoid materialized permutes; add correctness tests for strided/transposed reads.

9) Instrumentation & metrics
- Ensure each dispatch path emits:
  - backend, variant, dtype, shape, strides, alpha/beta flags.
- Integrate memory accounting: bytes read/written per kernel (approx) recorded for profiling builds.
- Add timing scopes around each kernel call.

10) A/B testing protocol
- Env flag to force variant/backend.
- Hidden test-only kernels under `exp_kernels` feature.
- Bench harness reads env and runs shape sweeps, outputs CSV.
- CI job (optional) to compare against baseline thresholds.

11) Tests
- Add MatmulDispatchOp routing tests using metallic_env guards to force MLX/MPS/LegacyGemv.
- Alpha/beta parity tests: fused epilogue vs composed matmul+add across shapes.
- Dispatcher threshold tuning: use env knobs to validate selection impacts and performance.
- Unit tests:
  - Dispatcher shape cases and env overrides (exhaustive for small matrix shapes).
  - Fused alpha/beta parity tests.
  - SDPA K-transpose logical-view tests.
  - Cache key uniqueness tests.
- Integration tests:
  - End-to-end matmul for representative shapes (small-N, medium, large) with synchronization.
- Property tests (optional):
  - Random shapes within constraints, verify numeric bounds.

12) Benchmarks
- Add dispatcher route breakdown metrics; tag with backend/variant.
- Sweep `METALLIC_MATMUL_SMALLN_MAX_N`, `METALLIC_MATMUL_SIMD_M_MIN`, `METALLIC_MATMUL_SIMD_N_MIN` for tuning.
- Output CSV including env settings for result provenance.
- Add/extend benches:
  - `benches/matmul_dispatcher_bench.rs`: Comprehensive dispatcher benchmarks with proper synchronization.
  - `benches/softmax_dispatcher_bench.rs`: Softmax parameterization and backend selection benchmarks.
- Emit per-variant metrics and write CSV; include device info.

13) Rollout & flags
- Introduce feature flag to route legacy ctx.matmul*, ctx.matmul_alpha_beta* through `matmul_dispatch`.
- Keep canary enablement per-op to allow quick rollback.
- Plan deprecation once parity/perf verified.
- Default: Auto dispatcher with MLX for GemmGeneric; Custom SmallN path disabled until kernel lands.
- Feature flags allow canary enabling of SmallN once implemented.
- Document env flags in README/docs.

14)   Risks and mitigations
- Risk: dispatcher complexity -> Mitigate by exhaustive enums, unit tests, and clear logging.
- Risk: zero-copy assumptions broken -> Validate strides and assert on mismatches; fall back with metrics when needed.
- Risk: cache key explosion -> Bucketize sizes (N, seq_k) and keep dtype/flags; test collisions.
- Risk: performance regressions -> A/B gates and benchmark thresholds; default to known-fast MLX.

15)  Definition of Done (DoD)
- [x] Dispatcher in place with unit tests and env flags.
- [x] Fused alpha/beta audit complete and parity tests added.
- [x] Softmax selection wired with parameterization (implementation may be naive, variant infra present).

- [x] Cache keys extended and tested.
- [x] Benches compile and run locally; instrumentation emits variant labels.
- [x] cargo fmt, clippy, and build pass.

17)  Known Issues and Technical Debt
- Alpha/Beta parity tests: Some GPU-based unfused computations have precision differences causing failures. The fix involves manually calculating expected results on CPU instead of using GPU operations for the unfused computation. This affects tests like `alpha_beta_gpu_parity_with_beta_mlx` and `alpha_beta_gpu_parity_with_beta_mps`.
