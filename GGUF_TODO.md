# GGUF File Loading and Integration Plan for Metallic Framework

This document outlines the steps required to implement GGUF file loading and integrate it into the Metallic framework for inference. The primary goals are to efficiently load large GGUF models, manage memory effectively, and support offloading and blockswapping layers.

## Phase 1: GGUF File Structure Parsing and Basic Loading

### 1. Understand GGUF Specification
- [ ] Deep dive into the official GGUF specification to understand header, metadata, and tensor data layout.
- [ ] Identify key data types, quantization formats, and metadata fields relevant for model inference.

### 2. Define GGUF Data Structures in Rust
- [ ] Create Rust structs to represent the GGUF header, metadata, and tensor information.
- [ ] Implement deserialization logic for these structures from a byte stream.

### 3. Implement Memory-Mapped File Loading
- [ ] Utilize `memmap2` or a similar crate to memory-map the GGUF file. This allows efficient access to large files without loading the entire content into RAM.
- [ ] Implement a `GGUFFile` struct that holds the memory-mapped region and provides methods for accessing different parts of the file (header, metadata, tensors).

### 4. Basic Tensor Data Access
- [ ] Implement methods to read tensor metadata (name, dimensions, type, offset) from the memory-mapped region.
- [ ] Implement methods to access the raw byte data of individual tensors.

## Phase 2: Metallic Framework Integration and Inference Preparation

### 5. Integrate with Metallic's Tensor Representation
- [ ] Define how GGUF tensor data will be converted or mapped to Metallic's internal tensor representation.
- [ ] Handle different GGUF data types and quantization formats, potentially requiring de-quantization or specific Metallic tensor types.

### 6. Model Loading and Graph Construction
- [ ] Develop a `GGUFLoader` component within Metallic that can take a `GGUFFile` and construct a Metallic `Model` graph.
- [ ] Map GGUF tensors (weights, biases) to corresponding layers in the Metallic model.

### 7. Initial Inference Test
- [ ] Load a simple GGUF model (e.g., a small feed-forward network) and perform a basic inference pass using the Metallic framework.
- [ ] Verify correctness of loaded weights and biases.

## Phase 3: Advanced Memory Management and Performance Optimization

### 8. Offloading Layers
- [ ] Design a strategy for identifying layers that can be offloaded (e.g., to CPU or disk) when GPU memory is limited.
- [ ] Implement mechanisms to swap layers in and out of GPU memory as needed during inference.

### 9. Blockswapping Layers
- [ ] Explore and implement blockswapping techniques for very large models, where only portions of a layer are loaded into memory at a time.
- [ ] This will likely involve more granular memory management and potentially custom memory allocators.

### 10. Quantization Handling
- [ ] Implement efficient handling of various GGUF quantization formats (e.g., Q4_0, Q8_0).
- [ ] Integrate de-quantization routines directly into the Metallic inference pipeline for performance.

## Phase 4: Error Handling and Robustness

### 11. Comprehensive Error Handling
- [ ] Implement robust error handling for file parsing, memory mapping, and data access.
- [ ] Provide clear error messages for invalid GGUF files or corrupted data.

### 12. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Develop a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests for GGUF loading and Metallic integration.
- [ ] Test with various GGUF models, including different sizes, quantization formats, and metadata configurations.
