Excellent, I have reviewed the provided files. Here is a detailed analysis and a comprehensive plan to integrate the high-performance CANDLE_MLX GEMM kernel into the metallic module.

  1. Analysis of `CANDLE_MLX` and `metallic`'s `matmul`

  `CANDLE_MLX` Kernel (`experimental/gemm-metal/src/`)

   * Core: It's a Metal port of Apple's MLX GEMM kernel. The mlx_gemm.metal file contains highly optimized code for matrix multiplication on Apple Silicon, using simdgroup_matrix operations.
   * Interface (`candle.rs`): The call_mlx_gemm function provides a Rust interface to the Metal kernel.
   * Strengths:
       * Performance: It's designed for high performance on Apple Silicon.
       * Flexibility: It handles transpositions (transpose_a, transpose_b) and non-contiguous memory layouts via strides (lda, ldb). This is crucial for handling tensor views without requiring memory copies.
       * Batching: It supports batched matrix multiplications.
       * Data Types: It supports F32, F16, and BF16.
   * Weaknesses (for our use case):
       * No `alpha`/`beta` support: The call_mlx_gemm function and the underlying gemm kernel in mlx_gemm.metal do not have parameters for alpha and beta for the operation D = alpha * A * B + beta * C. The function
         signature is for D = A * B. However, the metal file does contain code for TransformAxpby and GEMMAddMMParams, which suggests the potential to add this functionality. The do_axpby function constant is currently
         hardcoded to false in candle.rs.

  `metallic`'s `matmul` (`src/metallic/kernels/matmul/`)

   * Current Implementation: It relies on Apple's MetalPerformanceShaders (MPS) framework, specifically MPSMatrixMultiplication.
   * Variants:
       * MatMulOp: Implements C = A * B.
       * MatMulAlphaBetaOp: Implements D = alpha * A * B + beta * C.
   * Strengths:
       * Comprehensive: It already handles batching, transpositions, and alpha/beta scaling.
       * Robust: It's a well-tested and stable solution provided by Apple.
   * Weaknesses:
       * Performance: While fast, MPS can sometimes be outperformed by custom, highly-tuned Metal kernels like the one from MLX, especially for specific matrix sizes or layouts.
       * "Black Box": We have less control over the exact implementation and performance characteristics compared to a custom kernel.

  2. The Path Forward: Porting `CANDLE_MLX` to `metallic`

  The goal is to replace the MPS backend with our own high-performance kernel based on CANDLE_MLX. This will give us more control and potentially better performance. The main challenge is the lack of alpha/beta support
  in the current call_mlx_gemm implementation.

  Here is the proposed plan:

  Phase 1: Create a New `MatMul` Kernel with `alpha`/`beta` Support

   1. Create New Files:
       * Create src/metallic/kernels/matmul/mlx.rs. This will house the Rust-side logic for calling the kernel.
       * Create src/metallic/kernels/matmul/mlx.metal. This will be a modified version of mlx_gemm.metal.

   2. Adapt `mlx.metal`:
       * Copy the contents of experimental/gemm-metal/src/mlx_gemm.metal into src/metallic/kernels/matmul/mlx.metal.
       * The key is to enable the alpha/beta functionality. The gemm kernel function in the .metal file already takes addmm_params and has a use_out_source and do_axpby constant. We need to leverage this.

   3. Implement `mlx.rs`:
       * This file will contain a new MatMulMlxOp struct.
       * It will be responsible for loading the mlx.metal kernel and creating a MTLComputePipelineState.
       * It will have a call function similar to call_mlx_gemm, but it will need to:
           * Accept alpha and beta as parameters.
           * Set the use_out_source and do_axpby function constants to true when beta is not zero.
           * Pass the C buffer (the output buffer that is also an input) to the kernel.
           * Pass alpha and beta values via the GEMMAddMMParams struct to the kernel.

  Phase 2: Integration into `metallic`

   1. Create a Unified `matmul` Entry Point:
       * Modify src/metallic/context.rs (or a similar central place) where matmul is defined.
       * The public-facing matmul function should intelligently decide which backend to use (MPS or our new MLX kernel). Initially, we can add a flag to force the MLX kernel for testing. Long-term, it could be based on
         matrix sizes or other heuristics.

   2. Implement `KernelInvocable` for `MatMulMlxOp`:
       * Similar to MatMulAlphaBetaOp, implement the KernelInvocable trait for MatMulMlxOp.
       * The new function will be responsible for:
           * Handling tensor views and strides, and determining if transpositions are needed.
           * Calculating the lda, ldb parameters for the kernel.
           * Creating the output tensor.
           * Creating an Operation that, when encoded, will call the MLX kernel.

  Phase 3: Testing and Benchmarking

   1. Correctness Testing:
       * Create a new test file src/metallic/kernels/matmul/mlx_test.rs.
       * Add comprehensive tests to verify the correctness of the new MLX-based matmul against the existing MPS implementation.
       * Test various scenarios:
           * With and without transpositions.
           * Different alpha and beta values (especially 0 and 1).
           * Contiguous and non-contiguous tensors (views).
           * Various matrix dimensions (including non-aligned sizes).
           * Batched operations.

   2. Benchmarking:
       * Adapt the benchmark from experimental/gemm-metal/examples/bench.rs to compare:
           * metallic's original MPS-based matmul.
           * The new MLX-based matmul.
       * Run benchmarks across a range of matrix sizes to identify where the new kernel provides the most significant performance improvements.

  This plan will result in a new, high-performance GEMM implementation within metallic that is fully-featured, supporting alpha/beta scaling and complex tensor layouts, while giving us the performance benefits of the
  MLX kernel and the control of a custom solution.




Excellent, you've pinpointed the exact problem area. Slowdowns from transpose operations before a GEMM are a classic performance bottleneck. Using a GEMM that 
  requires a specific data layout without offering a transposed input option forces a costly memory copy.

  Based on my analysis of src/metallic/models/qwen25/mod.rs, particularly the forward_step function, here are the most promising opportunities for fusion in your 
  qwen25 generation path.

  The key principle is to combine sequential operations into a single custom Metal kernel, eliminating intermediate writes to and reads from device memory.

  High-Priority Fusion Opportunities

  These offer the biggest potential performance gains by targeting the patterns you're seeing.

   1. Fuse `RMSNorm` with the QKV Projection
       * Location: In forward_step, at the start of the attention block.
       * Current Code:

   1         // 1. Norm
   2         let x_normed_attn = ctx.call::<RMSNormOp>(...)?;
   3         // 2. MatMul
   4         let (q_mat, k_mat, v_mat) = ctx.fused_qkv_projection(&x_flat, ...)?;
       * Recommendation: Create a new, single kernel that accepts the un-normalized input x. This kernel will:
           1. Perform the RMS Normalization calculation.
           2. Use the normalized result directly (while it's still in registers or threadgroup memory) to perform the fused QKV projection MatMul.
       * Benefit: This completely eliminates the x_normed_attn tensor, saving a full memory write/read cycle, which is a significant win.

   2. Fuse `RMSNorm` with the SwiGLU MLP
       * Location: In forward_step, at the start of the MLP block.
       * Current Code:

   1         // 1. Norm
   2         let x_normed_mlp = ctx.call::<RMSNormOp>(...)?;
   3         // 2. SwiGLU
   4         let ffn_output_flat = ctx.SwiGLU(&x_normed_mlp_flat, ...)?;
       * Recommendation: This is the same pattern as above. Modify your existing SwiGLU kernel to take the un-normalized input x and the ffn_norm_gamma weights. The 
         kernel would then perform the RMSNorm internally before proceeding with the gate/up projections.
       * Benefit: Identical to the first point. It saves a full memory round-trip for the x_normed_mlp tensor.

  Medium-Priority Fusion Opportunities

  These are also valuable but may have slightly less impact than the norm fusions.

   3. Fuse Final MatMul with Residual Addition
       * Location: At the end of both the attention block (attn_output) and the MLP block (mlp_output).
       * Current Code:

   1         // Attention block
   2         let attn_out = ctx.matmul(...)?;
   3         x = resid_attn.add_elem(&attn_out, ctx)?;
   4 
   5         // MLP block
   6         let ffn_output = ffn_output_flat.reshape(...)?;
   7         x = resid_mlp.add_elem(&ffn_output, ctx)?;
       * Recommendation: Modify the MatMul operations (attn_out and the final projection within SwiGLU) to include the residual addition. Most GEMM implementations 
         (including MPS) support this via the "beta" and "C" parameters (D = alpha*A*B + beta*C). You would pass the residual tensor (resid_attn or resid_mlp) as the C 
         matrix and set beta to 1.
       * Benefit: This avoids creating the intermediate attn_out and ffn_output tensors just to add them, saving memory bandwidth.

  Addressing the transpose Bottleneck

  Your attn_output and final output MatMuls both use transpose=true on the weight matrix.

   1 // attn_output in forward_step
   2 let attn_out = ctx.matmul(..., &block.attn_out_weight, false, true)?;
   3 
   4 // Final output projection in output()
   5 let logits_flat = ctx.matmul(&flat_hidden, &self.output_weight, false, true)?;

  This is your core problem with the custom gemm-metal kernel.

   * Solution 1 (Best): Modify your custom GEMM kernel to accept a boolean flag for transposing the B matrix (the weights). The kernel can then adjust its indexing to 
     read from the weight matrix in a transposed manner without any preceding memory copy. This is standard practice for high-performance GEMM libraries.
   * Solution 2 (Workaround): If modifying the kernel is too complex right now, pre-transpose the weights when you load the model. Store attn_out_weight and 
     output_weight in their transposed layout from the beginning. This moves the cost from a per-token operation to a one-time operation at startup.



LATER....

Quick Wins (Lower implementation effort)

   1. Evaluate and Integrate the existing `experimental/gemm-metal` Kernel.
       * Observation: Your project has an experimental/gemm-metal directory containing mlx_gemm.metal. This is likely a custom, high-performance GEMM (General Matrix 
         Multiplication) kernel, possibly adapted from Apple's MLX framework, which is highly optimized for their silicon.
       * Recommendation: This is your most promising and immediate opportunity. Benchmark the performance of this experimental kernel against your current MPS-based 
         implementation. The experimental/gemm-metal/examples/bench.rs file should be the perfect starting point for this evaluation. If it's faster, prioritize 
         integrating it to replace the current MatMul (MPS) implementation.

   2. Leverage Fused Operations.
       * Observation: The matmul_alpha_beta.rs file suggests you might already be using fused multiply-add operations.
       * Recommendation: Ensure you are using this wherever possible. For example, a common pattern is Y = A * X + B. Instead of a separate MatMul and an element-wise 
         add, a single fused GEMM call is significantly faster as it reduces memory access. The beta parameter in a GEMM call is designed for this.

  Medium-Term Wins (Higher implementation effort)

   3. MatMul with Quantized Tensors.
       * Observation: Your project has a src/gguf/quant directory, which means you are already handling quantized data. However, it's common to de-quantize weights to 
         FP16/FP32 before performing MatMul.
       * Recommendation: The biggest performance gains often come from performing MatMul directly with quantized data types (e.g., 8-bit or 4-bit integers). This 
         drastically reduces the amount of data moved from memory to the GPU and can use specialized, faster compute units. Investigate and implement MatMul kernels 
         that operate directly on these lower-precision data types.

   4. Kernel Fusion.
       * Observation: A typical transformer block performs many operations sequentially (norm -> matmul -> rope -> ...).
       * Recommendation: Fuse the MatMul operation with the operations that come immediately before or after it. For example:
           * `LayerNorm + MatMul`: Create a single Metal kernel that performs layer normalization and the subsequent Q, K, or V projection MatMul without writing the 
             intermediate normalized tensor back to memory.
           * `MatMul + Activation`: In your MLP block, the mlp_swiglu step likely involves one or more matrix multiplications followed by a SiLU activation. Fuse the 
             MatMul and the activation function into a single kernel. This avoids a separate dispatch and memory round-trip.

  Longer-Term (Architectural Changes)
   5. Advanced Kernel Optimizations (Tiling).
       * Observation: The mlx_gemm.metal kernel likely already uses tiling.
       * Recommendation: If you decide to write your own kernels, the key optimization is "tiling". This involves breaking the input matrices into smaller blocks 
         (tiles) that fit into the GPU's fast local memory (threadgroup memory in Metal). This maximizes data reuse and minimizes reads from the much slower main 
         memory. This requires a deep understanding of the Metal shading language and GPU architecture.
